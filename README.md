This repository contains my notes of the awesome [Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub].

If you find any errors/inconsistencies or have any suggestions for improvement, do not hesitate to create a pull request. :smiley:

My final project for the zoomcamp is available in [padilha/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions](https://github.com/padilha/nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions).
